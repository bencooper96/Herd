          Herd verifies your location and empowers you to meaningfully connect
          to your reps. When they know that you are THEIR constituent, itâ€™s in
          their best interest to listen to you.

          Herd dialogue is rated from 0-10 instead like or dislike. The comment
          section is made of pros and cons. We strive to make easy insights from
